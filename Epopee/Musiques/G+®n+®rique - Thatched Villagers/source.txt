Thatched Villagers

Genre: Soundtrack Collection: Celtic and Folk 
Time: 4:04 95 BPM (Moderato - A Bit Fast) 
Instruments: Guitar, Recorder, Percussion, Dulcimer 
  -  

Solid in pace, The Thatched Roof Villagers moves with percussion and a number of flutes and pipes struggling for dominance. The real joy of the piece is halfway through when the tinny dulcimer plays the melody and is then joined by the flutes in melody and harmony. The music is jovial and inviting. Loopable.

Bouncy, Bright
