Failing Defense

Genre: Soundtrack Collection: Action 
Time: 1:46 86 BPM (Andante - Medium Speed) 
Instruments: Brass, Percussion, Xylophone, Strings 
  -  

This piece begins immediately with horn blasts, strings, and a bone-jangling xylophone. After the brief intro the horns play a melody, then the horns drop away away except tribal drums and staccato string bursts. The music returns in a big way, suggestive of a tense battle, as the instruments compete against each other, until the rapid discordant end.

Action, Aggressive, Intense, Suspenseful
